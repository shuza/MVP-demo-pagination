# This prject is to demonstrate pagination in android

----
## what is Pagination?
In a simple word, this means when we don't have data and user scroll to watch more data then load more data from data source. Data source can be Restful API or local data source like database, file or others.

----
## When to use Pagination?
It a frequent case when we have to deal with large data and have to show in a list like listview or recyclerview or gridview. We can divide the data part by part and when user wants to watch more data we can load the next part and display to user.

----
In this project I have loaded more data when only 2 item remains as loading more data may take sometime. We can change it depending on use case. We can also show a loader when loading more data or next part of the data from data source.
